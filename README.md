# Tic-Tac-Toe (JavaScript Edition)
The goal of this project was to create a browser-based Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game has 2 different modes: Player vs Player and Player vs Computer. 

In the Player vs Player mode, 2 human players can play against each other, with the symbols and starting order being randomly assigned.

In the Player vs Computer mode, a human player can play against the computer, with symbols and starting order being randomly assigned. The computer uses the minimax algorithm to calculate the best move to make on each turn, and due to the nature of the game, if at least 1 player plays optimally the worst outcome for the optimal player will be a draw. As a result, the computer player in this mode is unbeatable - the best result you can get is a draw.
